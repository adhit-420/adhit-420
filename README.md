# 👋 Hey there, I'm Adhit Simhadri


I'm currently diving into the world of **functional programming**, learning languages like Go, Rust, and Haskell. I'm also exploring **Artificial Intelligence** and **Machine Learning**, with a growing interest in reading and understanding **research papers**.

I'm passionate about **open source**—I love learning from the community and look forward to actively contributing to meaningful projects.
